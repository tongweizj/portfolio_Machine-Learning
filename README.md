# 🧠 Machine Learning Portfolio by Wei Tong

Welcome! This is my curated collection of hands-on machine learning projects built during my learning journey and practical experience.

Each project focuses on a different concept or real-world use case—ranging from traditional models like logistic regression to deep learning applications using CNNs, model compression, and optimization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Portfolio

- Apply machine learning concepts in real scenarios
- Demonstrate technical skills in Python, data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- Explore practical tools like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and deployment techniques
- Build a personal learning log to track progress and share with peers or potential employers
